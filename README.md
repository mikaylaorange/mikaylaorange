# <div align="center">Hey There! ðŸ§¡</div>


I'm Mikayla, a senior CS major at Howard University, and welcome to my little github! I'm a fan of front-end work (though trying to dabble more into back-end), and when I'm not writing code, I'm watching Joshua Weissman's cooking videos or listening to Korean pop sensation BTS. If you ever wanna work together or talk about cooking/BTS/how great Hamilton is, feel free to reach out!
